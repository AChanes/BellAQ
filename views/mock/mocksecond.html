                    <h2>Reading Section Directions</h2>
                    <p>This section measures your ability to understand academic passages in English. You will read 3 passages.
                        In an actual test you will have 60 minutes
                        <b>(1 hour)</b> to read the passages and answer the questions. </p>
                    <p>Most questions are worth 1 point but the last question in each set is worth more than 1 point. The directions
                        indicate how many points you may receive.</p>
                    <p>Some passages include a word or phrase that is
                        <span class="font-blu">
                            <u>underlined</u>
                        </span> in blue. Click on the word or phrase to see a definition or an explanation.</p>
                    <p>Within this section, you can go to the next question by clicking
                        <b>Next</b>. You may skip questions and go back to them later. If you want to return to previous questions,
                        click on
                        <b>Back</b>. You can click on
                        <b>Review</b> at any time and the review screen will show you which questions you have answered and
                        which you have not answered. From this review screen, you may go directly to any question you have
                        already seen in the Reading section.
                    </p>
                    <p>During this practice test, you may click the Pause icon at any time. This will stop the test until you
                        decide to continue. You may continue the test in a few minutes or at any time during the period that
                        your test is activated.</p>
                    <p>You may now begin the Reading section. Again, in an actual test you will have 60 minutes (1 hour) to
                        read the 3 passages and answer the questions. NOTE: Also in an actual test some test takers may receive
                        4 passages; those test takers will have 80 minutes (1 hour and 20 minutes) to answer the questions.</p>
                    <p>Click on
                        <b>Continue</b> to go on.</p>
